I started off adding in html elements to manipulate with javascript. First with table elements, and then textareas as well as buttons. 

Once I had the layout, I started on the logic of how to assign the class to the individual text areas based on the current time provided by momentjs. 

I added in an auto updating time header at the top, I added event listeners for the buttons to save the entries to localstorage, and then I added a function that would automatically loop through the key/values and then display them in the appropriate textarea upon page loading. 

I added a clear button to clear the local storage and then it reloads the page.
